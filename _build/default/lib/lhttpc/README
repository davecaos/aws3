# NO LONGER DEVELOPED #

ESL and Talko have stopped development work on this project. It exists for Erlcloud and others that still
depend on the lhttpc library, but if you're writing anything new you should really use a different HTTP client.

-----

Dependencies:
 * Erlang/OTP R13-B or newer
   * Application compiler to build, kernel, stdlib and ssl to run

Building:
For versions > 1.2.5, lhttpc is built using rebar. Take a look at http://bitbucket.org/basho/rebar/wiki/Home for more information. There is still a Makefile with some of the old make targets, such as all, doc, test etc. for those who prefer that. The makefile will however just call rebar.

Configuration: (environment variables)
 * connection_timeout: The time (in milliseconds) the client will try to
                       kepp a HTTP/1.1 connection open. Changing this value
                       in runtime has no effect, this can however be done
                       through lhttpc_manager:update_connection_timeout/1.
